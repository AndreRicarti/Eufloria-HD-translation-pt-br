02_strategy^Remember, you need ten seedlings to plant a tree!##Colonise new asteroids to expand your view.
03_strategy^Keep your asteroids well defended.
04_strategy^Asteroids with good resources produce effective seedlings.
05_strategy^Defensive trees are very dangerous, but can be taken down by sufficient high STRENGTH seedlings.##Older trees take longer to destroy, so try and attack them when they're young.
06_strategy^Don’t try to conquer the well defended asteroids. They are not required to complete the Level Goal.##Send scouts to uncover your surroundings.##Asteroids with a high SPEED attribute grow fast seedlings which can race past defences to undefended asteroids.
07_strategy^Quickly head right until you find and colonise the high ENERGY asteroid.##You often need to move fast to prevent your enemies becoming too strong.##High ENERGY seedlings sap asteroid cores faster.
08_strategy^Head left and make sure you create a seedling swarm of sufficient size and attributes before major battles.##Protect your first asteroid with some defense trees.##Terraform the first few acquired asteroids to boost new seedlings' STRENGTH.
09_strategy^It is essential to conquer the giant central asteroid.##Be wary of counter attacks however.
10_strategy^LASER PODS automatically re-grow on their tree of origin after being destroyed.##You can deploy them over and over again.
11_strategy^Make your move early before you become overwhelmed.
12_strategy^Enemies are less interested in weak asteroids. They are a good place to grow your army of 100.##Be prepared to back away quickly from a fight.##Finding friends is essential.
13_strategy^Let the enemy punch itself out on the defense trees to your right.##Instead, conquer the left side of the asteroid field and grow strong seedlings and LASER PODS.##Counter attack with a large swarm.
14_strategy^Defend choke points.##Build a massive army once you have control over a good area of space.
15_strategy^You can’t rush this mission.##Don’t overreach, but slowly methodically expand.
16_strategy^Be prepared to lose your starting asteroids. Instead, colonise undefended asteroids to the right.##Utilise ENHANCED SEEDLINGS, defend, and expand slowly.
17_strategy^Scout far and wide.##Discover other grey seedlings to keep numbers high enough.
18_strategy^Flee to the upper right corner when the first attack wave strikes.##Look for which corner to go to when the next major attack wave strikes, and once or twice more.##Start building your resources only after your second or third big move.##Find friends.
19_strategy^Don’t alert the grey swarm until you are ready to counter attack or defend.
20_strategy^Pick your fights carefully and scout for friendly seedlings.
21_strategy^Build a large force before you take on the large asteroid.##Once the enemy counter attack begins you can retake all the lost asteroids.
22_strategy^Only pick fights you can win!
23_strategy^Avoid strong enemies.##Carve out your own territory and grow ENHANCED SEEDLINGS and LASER PODS.##Defend choke points.
24_strategy^Avoid pointless battles.##Find a corner to defend and grow your forces.##Small asteroids are less likely to be invaded.
25_strategy^Defeat massive defences by staggering your attacks.##Don’t send all your seedlings at once.
